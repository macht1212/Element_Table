# Element_Table  

by Alexander Nazimov

## Introduction

The Periodic Table of Elements application is based on the "kivy" GUI library.

The application consists of two parts: a field for displaying information and the table itself, which is made in the form of buttons that send a query to the database and display information about the element on the screen.

The database is based on the built-in sqlite3 library.
